# Mouse Clicker
 A little c++ mouse clicker that "can join" my classes for me
 This is more of a small app for myself, but it's out there for anyone to see or use.
# Small Notes
 -Only works for windows(since I only work with windows). 
 -You should probably change the hard coded excuse message so that we don't both get caught.
 -When following the instructions, the join button mentioned in the console is the one in the image below.

# Side Note
 I do not condone the use of this program to actually miss classes, as online education is just as valid as in-person education.
